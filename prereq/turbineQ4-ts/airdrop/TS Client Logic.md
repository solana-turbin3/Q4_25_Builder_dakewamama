Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use Typescript for Client side development?

for me i feel lots of devs already use it
even before solana it was many people's first language coupled with the fact that typescript with node offer server side code, but compiled to javascript also runs in the browser

when you take all of this into account solana chose it for its rich ecosystem and low barrier to entry
on the call there was a question that lead to talking bout solana inheriting the devs via easy onboarding i,e if you know typescript, you can write for solana 

its simple logic you write code and people maintain it and give you feedback coming from the fact that if you write in a language that many people understand, many people can give you technical feedback and also maintain code.
nice one jeff :)
